                <br></br>
                <div>So far, Brazil’s tax authority has not provided any detailed instructions on the taxation
of rewards tokens or tokens acquired by mining or staking or regarding the tax
treatment of tokens received through airdrops and hard forks
<br></br><br></br>
The document states that virtual currencies must be declared. It explains that virtual currencies
(bitcoins, for example), although not considered as currency under the current regulatory framework,
should be declared in the Assets and Rights Tab as “other assets,” since they can be treated as a
financial asset. The acquisition value of the assets must be stated. This type of “currency” does not
have an official conversion rate, because there is no organ responsible for controlling its issue, so
there is no legal rule for the conversion of amounts for tax purposes. However, the taxpayer must
keep documentation proving the authenticity of these values.10
A question in the booklet asks whether gains obtained from the sale of virtual currency are taxed.
The answer provided indicates that where the gains obtained from the sale of virtual currencies
(bitcoins, for example) in one month is more than BRL35,000.00 (about US$6,573.63), these are taxed
as capital gains, with progressive rates applying, and income tax must be paid before the last
business day of the month following the month of the transaction. The taxpayer must keep
documentation proving the authenticity of the transactions.11
<br></br><br></br>
Under article 6,
[t]he obligation to provide information applies to a natural or legal person who carries out
any of the operations with cryptoassets listed below:
I - buying and selling;
II - exchange;
III - donation;
IV - transfer of cryptoasset to the exchange;
V - withdrawal of cryptoassets from the exchange;
VI - temporary assignment (rent);
VII - payment in kind;
VIII - issuance; and
IX - other operations that involve the transfer of cryptoassets.17
Article 7 of Normative Instruction No. 1888 specifies the information that must be provided for
each operation,18 while article 10 details the penalties applicable to a natural or legal person
who fails to provide the mandatory information pursuant to article 6, provides them outside
the deadlines set in article 8, or omits information or provides inaccurate, incomplete or
incorrect information.</div>

                <h4>Summary: </h4>
                <div>[t]he income tax treatment for cryptocurrency miners is different depending on whether
their mining activities are a personal activity (a hobby) or a business activity. This is
decided case by case. A hobby is generally undertaken for pleasure, entertainment or
enjoyment, rather than for business reasons. But if a hobby is pursued in a sufficiently
commercial and businesslike way, it can be considered a business activity and will be taxed
as such.17
<br></br><br></br>
[i]f the taxpayer mines in a commercial manner, the income from that business must be
included in the taxpayer’s income for the year. Such income will be determined with
reference to the value of the taxpayer’s inventory at the end of the year, established
pursuant to the rules in section 10 of the ITA and Part XVIII of the Regulations regarding
valuing inventory.1
<br></br><br></br>
value each item in the inventory at its cost when it was acquired or its fair market value
at the end of the year, whichever is lower
• value the entire inventory at its fair market value at the end of the year (generally, the
price that you would pay to replace an item or the amount that you would receive if
you sold an item)20

<br></br><br></br>
[i]f the sale of a cryptocurrency does not constitute carrying on a business, and the amount
it sells for is more than the original purchase price or its adjusted cost base, then the
taxpayer has realized a capital gain. Capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency are
generally included in income for the year, but only half of the capital gain is subject to tax.
This is called the taxable capital gain. Any capital losses resulting from the sale can only
be offset against capital gains; you cannot use them to reduce income from other sources,
such as employment income. You can carry forward your capital losses if you do not have
any capital gains against which to offset those losses for the year or any of the preceding
three years.</div>

The Internal Revenue Service (SII) issued a ruling on whether cryptocurrencies are subject to the
value added tax (VAT) and income tax.3 Under the ruling, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are
considered digital or virtual assets, and since they do not have “corporeality,” their sale is not
subject to VAT.4 Income derived from the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies is, however,
subject to income tax.5</div>

Under the Notice, a miner will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount 
equal to the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt.
<br></br><br></br>
Ultimately, the reward tokens that taxpayers receive in exchange for performing mining activities is taxed as ordinary income upon receipt.
The received tokens are also subject to self-employment or payroll taxes, depending on whether the taxpayer is mining as a trade or business, 
independent contractor or an employee. A taxpayer will trigger another taxable 
event when he or she ultimately sells the reward tokens, which is subject to short-term or the 
more preferential long-term capital gain rates, depending on the holding period of the tokens.</div>

According to tax experts, the activity of miners and virtual exchange houses are subject to income
tax for their business activity. The assets used by miners to generate the digital assets, such as the
technology equipment used, is subject to depreciation or revaluation for income tax computation
purposes.13</div>

                <div>Currency Tokens: used as a means of payment, clearing or barter only, do not confer
additional rights (such as a yield or ownership of an additional asset) and are not
controlled by a central entity. [They] will not be considered a security.
Utility Tokens: embody a right to a product or service, and are purchased for the purpose
of consumption and use only and not for the purpose of investment, will not be considered
a security.
Security Tokens: Grant similar rights to securities and will be considered securities.5
<br></br><br></br>
As noted, virtual currency is recognized by Israel’s Tax Authority as an asset. An income derived
from the sale of virtual currency by its owner may qualify as capital gain. The amount received
from the trade in excess of the original price, after deduction of inflationary value, will be taxed
at a rate of 25% for an individual and 23% for a corporation.
<br></br><br></br>
If, however, the income deriving from the sale of virtual currency meets the criteria for “a
business” as determined in Israeli case law, it may be subject to a “yielding income tax”
(YIT), at a progressive tax rate of 10-50% for an individual, or corporate tax at a rate of 23%
for a corporation. 15
<br></br><br></br>
In a situation where the receipt of consideration in virtual currency is not part of the main
business income or constitutes private income, for example, by utilizing an individual’s
personal computer at home for mining or verifying transactions, no tax event occurs upon
receiving or creating a new virtual currency. Capital gain, however, will accrue at the time
of sale or conversion of the new virtual currency to legal tenders such as new shekels or
foreign currency.16
<br></br><br></br>
[i]ndividual investors in virtual currencies are not liable for VAT, but anyone who engages
in mining will be classified as a dealer and could be subject to VAT. Businesses trading in
virtual currencies are classified as financial institutions for tax purposes and are exempt
from VAT, so VAT on expenses is not deductible and an additional 17% wage and profit
tax applies.2</div>

<div>For income tax purposes, profits generated by selling or using virtual currency are generally
classified as miscellaneous income.1 Miscellaneous income is a part of gross income.2 The income
tax rate ranges from 5 to 45%,3 and the local tax rate is 10%.4 Compared to the taxation on gains
on the transfer of corporate shares, the tax rate for which is about 20%,5 cryptocurrency gains are
highly taxed. On the other hand, for a corporation that earns profits from the sale of virtual
currency, the corporate tax rate is 19% to 23.4%.6 A local (resident and business) tax of 10.3% is
also imposed.7
<br></br>
The National Tax Agency has stated that when virtual currency is acquired by mining, its market
value at the time of acquisition is included in the total income amount in the calculation of the
amount of income (or in case of a corporation, in the amount of profit for purposes of the
corporate tax). The expenses incurred in mining will be included in the necessary costs for
calculating the amount of income (or in the amount of a corporation’s deduction for purposes of
the corporate tax).8</div>

<div>A miner’s profits from the disposal of the rewarded payment tokens received through
mining is taxable if the miner performs the mining activity with an intention to profit.
An individual engaging in mining activities is presumed to be undertaking the activity
as a hobby, and gains from sale of the mined payment tokens are not taxable, unless the
individual shows a habitual and systematic effort to make a profit from the activities.
A company engaging in mining activities will be taxed on profits from the sale of mined
payment tokens upon disposal of the tokens. The miner’s profits are taxed at the point
of disposal of the tokens and not at the point when the tokens are successfully mined,
since no income is derived by merely holding the payment token. 
<br></br>
A company engaging in mining activities is regarded as carrying on a business of mining, and
general tax rules will apply, since a company is generally set-up with a profit-seeking motive. It
will be taxed on profits from the sale of mined payment tokens upon disposal of the tokens. The
mining expenses are deductible.4
An individual engaging in mining activities, on the other hand, is presumed to be undertaking
the activity as a hobby. Gains from sale of the mined payment tokens are treated as capital gains
and are not taxable. However, if an individual shows a habitual and systematic effort to make a
profit from the activities, he or she may be considered as carrying on a vocation of a miner and
his profits from the sale of the mined tokens will be subject to tax.5
<br></br>
The miner’s profits from the rewarded payment tokens, if any, will be taxed at the point of
disposal of the tokens and not at the point when the tokens are successfully mined. The
Income Tax Guide explains that this is because while the miner is entitled to a right to own a
payment token at the point of successful mining, no income is derived by merely holding the
payment token.6</div>
