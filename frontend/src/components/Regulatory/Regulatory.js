                    debts or obligations.4 According to some experts,5 a Bitcoin may be considered a good or a thing
                    under the Civil Code,6 and transactions with Bitcoins may be governed by the rules of the sale of

                <h4>Summary:</h4>
                <br></br>
                <div>So far, Brazil’s tax authority has not provided any detailed instructions on the taxation
of rewards tokens or tokens acquired by mining or staking or regarding the tax
treatment of tokens received through airdrops and hard forks
<br></br><br></br>
The document states that virtual currencies must be declared. It explains that virtual currencies
(bitcoins, for example), although not considered as currency under the current regulatory framework,
should be declared in the Assets and Rights Tab as “other assets,” since they can be treated as a
financial asset. The acquisition value of the assets must be stated. This type of “currency” does not
have an official conversion rate, because there is no organ responsible for controlling its issue, so
there is no legal rule for the conversion of amounts for tax purposes. However, the taxpayer must
keep documentation proving the authenticity of these values.10
A question in the booklet asks whether gains obtained from the sale of virtual currency are taxed.
The answer provided indicates that where the gains obtained from the sale of virtual currencies
(bitcoins, for example) in one month is more than BRL35,000.00 (about US$6,573.63), these are taxed
as capital gains, with progressive rates applying, and income tax must be paid before the last
business day of the month following the month of the transaction. The taxpayer must keep
documentation proving the authenticity of the transactions.11
<br></br><br></br>
Under article 6,
[t]he obligation to provide information applies to a natural or legal person who carries out
any of the operations with cryptoassets listed below:
I - buying and selling;
II - exchange;
III - donation;
IV - transfer of cryptoasset to the exchange;
V - withdrawal of cryptoassets from the exchange;
VI - temporary assignment (rent);
VII - payment in kind;
VIII - issuance; and
IX - other operations that involve the transfer of cryptoassets.17
Article 7 of Normative Instruction No. 1888 specifies the information that must be provided for
each operation,18 while article 10 details the penalties applicable to a natural or legal person
who fails to provide the mandatory information pursuant to article 6, provides them outside
the deadlines set in article 8, or omits information or provides inaccurate, incomplete or
incorrect information.</div>

                <h4>Summary: </h4>
                <div>[t]he income tax treatment for cryptocurrency miners is different depending on whether
their mining activities are a personal activity (a hobby) or a business activity. This is
decided case by case. A hobby is generally undertaken for pleasure, entertainment or
enjoyment, rather than for business reasons. But if a hobby is pursued in a sufficiently
commercial and businesslike way, it can be considered a business activity and will be taxed
as such.17
<br></br><br></br>
[i]f the taxpayer mines in a commercial manner, the income from that business must be
included in the taxpayer’s income for the year. Such income will be determined with
reference to the value of the taxpayer’s inventory at the end of the year, established
pursuant to the rules in section 10 of the ITA and Part XVIII of the Regulations regarding
valuing inventory.1
<br></br><br></br>
value each item in the inventory at its cost when it was acquired or its fair market value
at the end of the year, whichever is lower
• value the entire inventory at its fair market value at the end of the year (generally, the
price that you would pay to replace an item or the amount that you would receive if
you sold an item)20

<br></br><br></br>
[i]f the sale of a cryptocurrency does not constitute carrying on a business, and the amount
it sells for is more than the original purchase price or its adjusted cost base, then the
taxpayer has realized a capital gain. Capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency are
generally included in income for the year, but only half of the capital gain is subject to tax.
This is called the taxable capital gain. Any capital losses resulting from the sale can only
be offset against capital gains; you cannot use them to reduce income from other sources,
such as employment income. You can carry forward your capital losses if you do not have
any capital gains against which to offset those losses for the year or any of the preceding
three years.</div>

the country and trade and transactions involving cryptocurrency are not subject to the regulation

The Internal Revenue Service (SII) issued a ruling on whether cryptocurrencies are subject to the
value added tax (VAT) and income tax.3 Under the ruling, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are
considered digital or virtual assets, and since they do not have “corporeality,” their sale is not
subject to VAT.4 Income derived from the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies is, however,
subject to income tax.5</div>

Under the Notice, a miner will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount 
equal to the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt.
<br></br><br></br>
Ultimately, the reward tokens that taxpayers receive in exchange for performing mining activities is taxed as ordinary income upon receipt.
The received tokens are also subject to self-employment or payroll taxes, depending on whether the taxpayer is mining as a trade or business, 
independent contractor or an employee. A taxpayer will trigger another taxable 
event when he or she ultimately sells the reward tokens, which is subject to short-term or the 
more preferential long-term capital gain rates, depending on the holding period of the tokens.</div>

cryptoassets, including the petro.12
According to tax experts, the activity of miners and virtual exchange houses are subject to income
tax for their business activity. The assets used by miners to generate the digital assets, such as the
technology equipment used, is subject to depreciation or revaluation for income tax computation
purposes.13</div>

                <div>Currency Tokens: used as a means of payment, clearing or barter only, do not confer
additional rights (such as a yield or ownership of an additional asset) and are not
controlled by a central entity. [They] will not be considered a security.
Utility Tokens: embody a right to a product or service, and are purchased for the purpose
of consumption and use only and not for the purpose of investment, will not be considered
a security.
Security Tokens: Grant similar rights to securities and will be considered securities.5
<br></br><br></br>
As noted, virtual currency is recognized by Israel’s Tax Authority as an asset. An income derived
from the sale of virtual currency by its owner may qualify as capital gain. The amount received
from the trade in excess of the original price, after deduction of inflationary value, will be taxed
at a rate of 25% for an individual and 23% for a corporation.
<br></br><br></br>
If, however, the income deriving from the sale of virtual currency meets the criteria for “a
business” as determined in Israeli case law, it may be subject to a “yielding income tax”
(YIT), at a progressive tax rate of 10-50% for an individual, or corporate tax at a rate of 23%
for a corporation. 15
<br></br><br></br>
In a situation where the receipt of consideration in virtual currency is not part of the main
business income or constitutes private income, for example, by utilizing an individual’s
personal computer at home for mining or verifying transactions, no tax event occurs upon
receiving or creating a new virtual currency. Capital gain, however, will accrue at the time
of sale or conversion of the new virtual currency to legal tenders such as new shekels or
foreign currency.16
<br></br><br></br>
[i]ndividual investors in virtual currencies are not liable for VAT, but anyone who engages
in mining will be classified as a dealer and could be subject to VAT. Businesses trading in

<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>For income tax purposes, profits generated by selling or using virtual currency are generally
classified as miscellaneous income.1 Miscellaneous income is a part of gross income.2 The income
tax rate ranges from 5 to 45%,3 and the local tax rate is 10%.4 Compared to the taxation on gains
on the transfer of corporate shares, the tax rate for which is about 20%,5 cryptocurrency gains are
highly taxed. On the other hand, for a corporation that earns profits from the sale of virtual
currency, the corporate tax rate is 19% to 23.4%.6 A local (resident and business) tax of 10.3% is
also imposed.7
<br></br>
The National Tax Agency has stated that when virtual currency is acquired by mining, its market
value at the time of acquisition is included in the total income amount in the calculation of the
amount of income (or in case of a corporation, in the amount of profit for purposes of the
corporate tax). The expenses incurred in mining will be included in the necessary costs for
calculating the amount of income (or in the amount of a corporation’s deduction for purposes of
the corporate tax).8</div>

<div>A miner’s profits from the disposal of the rewarded payment tokens received through
mining is taxable if the miner performs the mining activity with an intention to profit.
An individual engaging in mining activities is presumed to be undertaking the activity
as a hobby, and gains from sale of the mined payment tokens are not taxable, unless the
individual shows a habitual and systematic effort to make a profit from the activities.
A company engaging in mining activities will be taxed on profits from the sale of mined
payment tokens upon disposal of the tokens. The miner’s profits are taxed at the point
of disposal of the tokens and not at the point when the tokens are successfully mined,
since no income is derived by merely holding the payment token. 
<br></br>
A company engaging in mining activities is regarded as carrying on a business of mining, and
general tax rules will apply, since a company is generally set-up with a profit-seeking motive. It
will be taxed on profits from the sale of mined payment tokens upon disposal of the tokens. The
mining expenses are deductible.4
An individual engaging in mining activities, on the other hand, is presumed to be undertaking
the activity as a hobby. Gains from sale of the mined payment tokens are treated as capital gains
and are not taxable. However, if an individual shows a habitual and systematic effort to make a
profit from the activities, he or she may be considered as carrying on a vocation of a miner and
his profits from the sale of the mined tokens will be subject to tax.5
<br></br>
The miner’s profits from the rewarded payment tokens, if any, will be taxed at the point of
disposal of the tokens and not at the point when the tokens are successfully mined. The
Income Tax Guide explains that this is because while the miner is entitled to a right to own a
payment token at the point of successful mining, no income is derived by merely holding the
payment token.6</div>

This gives rise to an immediate accrual or receipt on successful mining of the

<div>A. Tax Treatment of Mined and Staked Cryptocurrencies
The Danish Tax Authority (Skatteforvaltningen) has issued guidance for the tax treatment of
mined cryptocurrencies. The guidance treats mining as a hobby.10 When carried out on a large
scale over an extended period, mining is considered a commercial activity.11 The Income Tax Act
provides that a person must report and pay income tax on proceeds from hobbies.12 Financial
losses incurred as part of a hobby (a.k.a. non-commercial) activity are not deductible.13 Costs
associated with the procurement of income from hobbies are typically not deductible.14 Costs
incurred in mining on a commercial scale, such as the cost of electricity and of the mining
computer, are deductible.1
<br></br>
Cryptocurrency tokens are treated as investment property and capital gains are taxed upon their
sale.22 The taxation of each cryptocurrency is determined individually, using the first in first out
(FIFO) principle to determine the cost basis.23 For tokens that have no purchase value, the fair
market value at the time of mining will apply.24 Depending on how they were acquired,
cryptocurrencies received as gifts may not be subject to tax upon realization.2</div>

<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>Specifically, cryptocurrencies are
subject to several income tax provisions, including 32 § (on capital gains), 45 § 1 para. (on transfer
gain), and 46 § 1 para. (on calculation of transfer gain).5 Because cryptoassets are not recognized
as legal monetary currencies, cryptocurrencies are not covered by the exemption to tax liability
for currency gains of less than €500 (about US$610).6
<br></br>
s
Finland taxes cryptocurrencies both at the acquisition stage and at the realization stage
<br></br>
[t]he point in time when income is realized for purposes of taxation is when the miner
gains possession of the new units of virtual currency. The income is valued at the market
value of the virtual currency at that time. The amount of income received is also the gross
acquisition cost for the newly acquired virtual currency. The acquisition cost of the
miner’s old virtual currency remains unchanged
<br></br>

From the perspective of taxation, the acquisition cost of the original virtual currency
remains unchanged, and the acquisition cost of the new currency is €0.00. In situations
like the above, if the taxpayer uses or exercises their new position (when taxes are
assessed as provided in the act on income tax, i.e. the taxpayer is an individual or an
estate of a deceased person), the tax calculation must be based on a deemed acquisition
cost of the position</div>

<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>A. Non-professionals
Since January 1, 2018, the global value added of all taxable operations realized by nonprofessional cryptocurrency investors during the year is subject to a flat tax of 30%.11 The sale of
cryptocurrency for euros or other legal currencies is the operation that generates the obligation
to pay the tax.12 Cryptocurrency owners who hold onto their crypto-assets without converting
them into fiat currency therefore do not have to pay taxes.1
<br></br>

Cryptocurrency miners are taxed differently according to whether their revenue is above or
below 70,000 euros (approximately US$85,000).14 If their revenue for a given year is no more than
70,000 euros, they are simply taxed according to the income tax scale, but after a flat 34%
abatement.15 For example, if a miner receives 50,000 euros in a cryptocurrency for his or her
mining activities, he or she will be taxed only on the basis of 33,000 euros after the abatement is
applied.16 If a cryptocurrency miner’s revenue is above 70,000 euros, he or she no longer qualifies
for the flat abatement and must instead itemize deductions.17 Furthermore, he or she is not taxed
according to the income tax scale, but according to the corporate tax scale.18
In either case, for tax purposes, the cryptocurrency mined is valued at the point in time when the
miner receives it.19 However, if the cryptocurrency is not immediately converted into fiat
currency, any value added may be taxed later when it is converted.20

<br></br>
2. Cryptocurrency Traders
Professional cryptocurrency traders whose total revenues are not over 170,000 euros
(approximately US$206,500) may claim a flat abatement of 71%, and are taxed according to the
French income tax scale for the remainder.21 Traders whose total revenues exceed 170,000 euros
are taxed according to the corporate tax scale, after itemized deductions instead of the flat
abatement.22 It appears that, for purposes of taxing professional traders, cryptocurrencies are
valuated when they are traded for official currency.23

<div>With regard to mining, the federal ministry of finance in its 2018 guidance held that bitcoin
mining is a nontaxable transaction.12 It noted that miners fulfill a service that is central to
maintaining the bitcoin system. They make their processing power available to a mining pool, record transactions in a “block,” and subsequently add it to a “blockchain.” The ministry of
finance stated that the transaction fee, which miners can receive from other users of the system,
is paid on a voluntary basis and is not directly related to the services provided by the miners. It
further added that receiving new bitcoin from the bitcoin system (block rewards) cannot be
classified as payment for mining services because there is no exchange of services, as that requires
an identifiable beneficiary.1

<h3 id="Italy">Italy</h3>
<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>A. Virtual Currencies (Cryptoassets) as Foreign Fiat Currencies
For tax purposes, Italy considers virtual currencies (cryptoassets) as foreign fiat currencies.13 Italy
is among the few countries that “do not consider any exchanges made by individuals to be a
taxable event for the holder of the virtual currency,”14 unless they are considered to be
speculative,15 as will be explained below.
<br></br>
With respect to personal income tax, “the profits generated by the trading of crypto assets are
regarded as those deriving from FOREX [foreign exchange] trading for personal tax purposes.”17
As a result, “in their annual tax return, individuals residing in Italy must specify whether they
have any cryptocurrencies held in e-wallets, just as they have to declare if they have money held
in foreign bank accounts.”18
Revenue from speculative transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject to the same rules applicable
to income stemming from exchanges in foreign fiat currencies, that is, a flat 26% substitutive tax
for Italian resident individuals, and it is also subject to the standard corporate income tax for
businesses.19 Transactions in cryptocurrencies are deemed speculative in the following situations:
(a) “when during the fiscal year and for at least seven consecutive days, the threshold of
ownership of virtual currencies exceeds circa €51,000 (about US$61,000);”
(b) “if the profit from trading exceeds €51,646 (about US$61,739) for seven consecutive
days;” and
(c) “companies subject to corporate income tax must pay taxes on the exchange movements
between virtual currencies and fiat currencies.”20
As a result, in Italy the disposal of the token for goods and services does not give rise to a taxable
event for the owner of the virtual currency,21 as this country does “not consider any disposals to
be a taxable event in relation to the token.”22
<br></br>
C. VAT Treatment of Virtual Currencies in Italy
In Italy, the exchange of virtual currencies is not subject to VAT,23 whether the exchange “is made
for fiat currency or other virtual currencies.”24 The use of virtual currencies to acquire goods or
services is also outside the scope of VAT.25 However, the receipt of new tokens via mining is
subject to the VAT.26</div>

<h3 id="Norway">Norway</h3>
<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>The Norwegian Tax Authority (Skatteetaten) has issued guidance for the tax treatment of mining
of cryptocurrencies. The Tax Authority typically treats mining as a hobby, the income from which
is not taxed
<br></br>
Hobbies are not taxed, while
commercial activity is.9 Whether mining constitutes a commercial activity will depend on its
scope and duration.10 According to the Tax Authority, staked cryptocurrencies are treated as
mined cryptocurrencies for purposes of income taxation.11 Holders must report their proof of
work and proof of stake protocols on their tax return
<br></br>
Persons must report proceeds from hobbies as well as from commercial activity.13 Income from
hobby activity, such as mined virtual currencies, is reported as “other income.”14 Conversely,
virtual currencies derived as part of a larger-scale activity must be reported as “commercial
activity.”15 The Tax Authority has issued guidelines on how to complete the income form with
respect to virtual currency income and losses.16 The value to be included for mined and staked
currencies is the fair market value at the time of the mining.17 Costs incurred in mining or staking
the virtual currencies, such as electricity, are deductible.18

<br></br>
C. Tax Treatment of Tokens at Time of Sale
Cryptocurrencies are treated the same at the time of sale for tax purposes, regardless of the way
the cryptocurrency was acquired. All sales are taxable events.22 Taxes are paid on the amount the
sales price exceeds the cost for acquiring the asset, i.e. the capital gain.23 Typically, the value of
the capital gain is calculated by deducting the original asset purchase price from the sales price.
In the cases where the asset was obtained through mining, the taxable income will be the price at
the time of sale minus the market value at the time of acquisition. For cryptocurrencies acquired
through gifts, the initial value is set at the value first acquired by the giver if the giver is
Norwegian, or at market value at the time of receipt if the giver is not Norwegian.24 If the value
of the cryptocurrency at acquisition is not known, the value will be set to zero and the entire
amount the cryptocurrency is sold for will be considered taxable and subject to capital gains tax.25</div>

<div>B. Mining, Staking, and Airdropping
Article 14 of the Law deals with the circulation of digital currency. Despite the fact that the exact
definitions of mining, stacking, airdropping or hard fork are not used in the text of the Law, it
defines DFA operations, covering activities such as the following:
• [T]he organization of issuance of digital currency utilizing domain names and network
addresses located in Russian domain zone and/or utilizing information systems,
technical equipment and/or software-hardware systems, located on Russian territory
as parts of Russian informational infrastructure.)1
<br></br>
• [T]he issuance of digital currency is an activity involving Russian information
infrastructure and /or user equipment located in Russia aimed at enabling the use of
digital currency by third parties.15
• Arranging circulation of the digital currency is a provision of services with the purpose
of facilitating civil law transactions and/or trading operations resulting in the transfer
of digital currency from one holder to another with the use of the Russian information
infrastructure.16
These activities are considered services and will be regulated as such by federal legislation.17
<br></br>
The Law explicitly prohibits use of digital currency as a means of payment for goods, works or
services by Russian legal entities, Russian branches or representative offices of foreign legal
entities, individual Russian taxpayers, and individuals residing in Russia more than 183 days a
year.18 Enforcement of this provision began on August 26, 2020, when Russia’s government
blocked the country’s top crypto exchange aggregator.19
<br></br>

The bill would establish requirements for declaring cryptocurrency by citizens, individuals or
legal entities operating in the Russian Federation and impose tax liability for unlawful failure
to declare information or declaring false information about transactions with cryptocurrency.
The amendments provide for the recognition of cryptocurrency as an asset and set out its
taxation accordingly.
Under this bill, citizens and lawful residents of the Russian Federation, registered legal and
corporate entities, registered representatives of foreign companies and international institutions
on the territory of the Russian Federation are obliged to declare information about obtaining the
right to dispose of digital currency, including through third parties, to submit a report on
transactions with digital currency, and on digital currency balances.25
Article 38 states that cryptocurrency shall be treated as “assets” subject to a mandatory
declaration to the Russian tax authorities.2</div>

Mining of cryptocurrencies qualifies as income from a hobby unless done on a commercial scale.5
The Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) has established that any
profits made when selling Bitcoins is subject to taxation as capital gains.6

The Swedish Tax Authority specifically
considers the following circumstances, among others, when determining if the mining of
cryptocurrencies is a hobby or a commercial activity:
• That the activity is undertaken in a regular, professional, and cost efficient manner
during a longer period of time with expedient equipment.
• That the activity can be expected to generate a surplus as determined across the entire
financial calculation period.
• That the equipment’s calculation capacity can be expected to generate more than 25
bitcoins annually (or an equitable amount in the form of transaction fees or other
virtual currency).17

<h4>Summary: </h4>
<br></br>
<div>Receiving a block
reward is generally not a taxable event for Swiss VAT purposes. Pool mining and pool
staking are both taxable under VAT law and are treated the same.
<br></br>
Native tokens are defined as “digital
value rights that are suitable to be used as a means of payment depending on their circulation
and infrastructure. The issuer does not have an obligation to make a certain payment or provide
a service vis-à-vis the investor.”2 Asset tokens represent “monetary claims against the issuer or
counterparty within the framework of an initial coin offering (ICO) or an initial token offering
(ITO).”3 Their tax treatment depends on the civil law relationship between the issuer and
investor.4 Utility tokens that are issued within the framework of an ICO or an ITO are those that
provide investors with the right to use digital services on a (decentralized) platform service
generally by means of a blockchain-based infrastructure.5 As with asset-backed tokens, their tax
treatment depends on the civil law relationship between the issuer and investor.6
<br></br>

The FTA in its cryptocurrency tax guidance issued in August 2019 only discussed mining and the
taxation of block rewards with regard to native tokens. However, it pointed out that the guidance
is only a snapshot of the tax situation up to May 2019 and will be continuously developed as new
situations arise, in particular with regard to ICOs/ITOs.

<br></br>
Native tokens are intangible assets and therefore subject to wealth tax.10 In Switzerland, the
individual cantons, the Swiss states, are obligated to levy income tax and wealth tax on the total
property (assets and rights with a cash value) of taxpayers that are resident in their canton.11
Property is assessed at market value at the end of the tax period.12 Tax rates vary between the
individual cantons. Cryptocurrencies are treated like foreign currencies for wealth tax purposes.
Holders of cryptocurrencies are taxed at the rate determined by the tax authorities on December
31st of the fiscal year
<br></br>
Block rewards received for mining do not qualify as compensation as defined in the VAT Act,
because there is no exchange of services.17 If validating blockchain transactions is only
compensated with block rewards, it does not qualify as an activity aimed at making a profit and
is therefore not a business activity.18 On the other hand, if the miner receives a transaction fee as
compensation for the validation of a block, there is a taxable exchange of services between the
miner and the network users. The validation of the transaction is subject to the general VAT rate
for a beneficiary located within the tax territory.19 A block reward that is generated in addition to
the transaction fee has no influence on the input tax deduction.20
<br></br>
The VAT guidance states that with regard to pool staking, owners of staking coins/tokens may
participate in a staking pool by contributing their stakes. In general, they are compensated with
a percentage in the transaction fee received for the staking. The staking pool operates the staking
software. There is a tax-relevant exchange of services between the individual participants and the
staking pool. The place of performance is determined according to section 8, paragraph 1 of the
VAT Act

<div>initially form part of trading stock. If these cryptoassets are transferred out of trading stock,
the business will be treated as if they bought them at the value used in trading accounts.
Businesses should use this value as an allowable cost in calculations when they dispose of
the cryptoassets
<br></br>
Thus, the transfer of a cryptoasset out of trading stock counts as a sale at market value for trading
purposes, and a profit or loss must be calculated at this time. If the token is subsequently disposed 
of, capital gains tax or corporate rate tax is calculated according to the market value at the date
the cryptoasset was taken out of trading stock.
<br></br>
HMRC notes that, if the mining activity does not amount to a taxable trade, the value at the time
of receipt of any cryptoassets awarded as a result of mining will be taxed as miscellaneous
income,14 and the individual will have to complete a self-assessment tax return unless the
cryptoassets are worth less than £1,000 (approximately US$1,400) or the individual has received
less than £2,500 (approximately US$3,300) from other untaxed income
<br></br>
In cases where individuals mining cryptoassets decide to keep any they have mined, capital gains
tax may later become payable when the asset is disposed of.17 Disposal of cryptoassets may occur
when selling cryptoassets for regular currency, exchanging one form of cryptoassets for another,
using cryptoassets to pay for goods or services, or giving cryptoassets away to someone who is
not the owner’s spouse or civil partner. In the case of cryptoassets that have been taxed as income,
any capital gains tax due will be reduced by the amount of income tax.1
<br></br>
HMRC has noted that individuals holding cryptoassets as a personal investment will be liable to
pay capital gains tax when the assets are disposed of. 
<br></br>
The disposal of a cryptoasset received through an airdrop may result in a chargeable gain
for Capital Gains Tax, even if it’s not chargeable to Income Tax when it’s received. Where
changes in value get brought into account as part of a computation of trade profits Income
Tax will take priority over Capital Gains Tax.</div>

<div>However,
while tokens acquired through mining cryptocurrencies as a hobby are only taxed on
disposal, through the capital gains tax system, tokens received by an individual as a
payment or reward for forging, staking, or voting are treated as ordinary income.
Airdropped tokens are also treated as ordinary income. The disposal of such tokens will
also trigger a capital gains tax event. New cryptocurrency received by an investor as a
result of a chain split is only taxable on disposal, with the capital gains tax rules
applicable to any resulting gain or loss. 
<br></br>
Investing
[i]f you acquire cryptocurrency as an investment, you may have to pay tax on any capital
gain you make on disposal of the cryptocurrency.
You will make a capital gain if the capital proceeds from the disposal of the cryptocurrency
are more than its cost base. Even if the market value of your cryptocurrency changes, you
do not make a capital gain or loss until you dispose of it.
If you hold the cryptocurrency as an investment, you will not be entitled to the personal
use asset exemption. However, if you hold your cryptocurrency as an investment for 12
months or more, you may be entitled to
<br></br>
Where a person mines cryptocurrency as a hobby, mined coins do not need to be reported as income;
taxes are only payable upon their disposal (i.e., a CGT event).Business miners, however, must
report the fair market value of the tokens received at the time of receipt, and may deduct miningrelated business expenses, such as equipment and electricity.
<br></br>
tax treatment of block rewards
Proof of Stake is a form of "consensus mechanism" that requires forgers (similar to miners)
to hold units of a cryptocurrency so they can validate transactions and create new blocks.
Forgers participate in consensus by staking their existing tokens.
A forger who is selected to forge a new block is rewarded with additional tokens when the
new block has been created. The additional tokens are received from holding the original
tokens. The money value of those additional tokens is ordinary income of the forger at the
time they are derived.
Other consensus mechanisms that reward existing token holders for their role in
maintaining the network will have the same tax outcomes. This would include rewards
derived through Proof of Authority and Proof of Credit mechanisms by Validators,
Agent Nodes, Guardian Nodes, Premium Stakers and other entities performing
comparable roles.
Token holders who participate in "proxy staking" or who vote their tokens in delegated
consensus mechanisms, and receive a reward by doing so, also derive ordinary income
equal to the money value of the tokens they receive.19
<br></br>

airdrops
[s]ome projects "airdrop" new tokens to existing token holders as a way of increasing
the supply of tokens (for example, Pundi X and Tron). The money value of an
established token received through an airdrop is ordinary income of the recipient at
the time it is derived.2

people can buy, sell, and exchange cryptoassets; provide goods or services in
exchange for them; mine cryptoassets; and earn staking rewards (or “crypto interest”)
among other things[.] . . .
There are no special tax rules for cryptoassets in New Zealand. The guidance clarifies
how ordinary income tax rules apply to cryptoassets to help people understand their
tax obligations.
Essentially, cryptoassets are treated as a form of property for tax purposes. What people
make from selling, trading or exchanging crypto-assets is taxable.5
<br></br>
[i]n most cases, cryptoassets you get from mining (such as transaction fees and block
rewards) are taxable. You may also need to pay income tax on any profit you make if you
later sell or exchange your mined cryptoassets.
When you mine cryptoassets, you may have to pay tax because you:
• are in the business of mining cryptoassets
• carry on a profit-making scheme
• earn ordinary income from providing mining services
• mine cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal (to sell or exchange).28
